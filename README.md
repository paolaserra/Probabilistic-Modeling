# Probabilistic-Modeling


The project aims to implement a Bayesian Network on a Pokemon dataset, trying to understand a pattern between all the features that make a Pokemon strongest.
Three different algorithms were implemented to perform this task: Hill-climbing, Incremental association Markov Blanket and Max-Min Hill Climbing.
In the last part a final model is chosen and some estimations about conditional probabilities are performed.
